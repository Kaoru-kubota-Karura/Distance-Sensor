Step Three
    Send the code to Arduino and make sure it works

Step Four
    Close the Arduino IDE 

Step Five 
    Open DataSave.py and start runnning the code by pressing triangle button which located top right of the Visual Studio code

Step Six
    Data will save "data_log.csv" and able to get graph until you stop the code or disconect to Arduino
